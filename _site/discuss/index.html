Created with <code>React.js</code>, <code>Next.js</code>, and <code>TailwindCSS</code>, this site facilitates crypto discussion around the <code>Fantom Blockchain</code>. This site accepts <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> through <strong>web3-smartcontract</strong> interaction, the transfer of money is executed by <strong>smart contracts</strong> which are audited for security purposes. A <strong>smart contract</strong> is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between <strong>buyer</strong> and <strong>seller</strong> being directly written into lines of code. This site is a <strong>community forum first</strong> and currently is going through a closed-launch to a small group of users.</p><h1 id=futureplans>Future plans?</h1><p>Currently the vision is to develop this forum much further beyond what it is today: integrated payment systems, powerful marketplace features, reputation systems, developed user-groups and roles are a few things on the internal list. For now it is a unique space to share your thoughts, meet people, and make money!</p><p>Come check us <a href=https://discuss.fantom.digital/ >out</a>!</p><p align=center><img src=/img/upgrade.jpeg></p><p>â€¦return to <a href=https://projects.ibrahimsaid.ca/ ><code>projects.ibrahimsaid.ca</code></a> or <a href=https://www.ibrahimsaid.ca/ ><code>ibrahimsaid.ca</code></a>.</p><link rel=stylesheet href=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.1.2/styles/nord.min.css><script src=//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/10.1.2/highlight.min.js></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script></body></html><script src="/reload/reload.js"></script>
