The motor in question (DC), converts direct current into mechanical energy. That mechanical energy is used to rotate the rotor; how fast that rotor spins is dependant of the resultant force. When a wire that carries current is placed in a region of space that has a magnetic field, the wire experiences a force. The magnet provides the magnetic field in this simple DC motor. The rotor (wire) then experiences torque and spins.</p><h2 id=how>How?</h2><ul><li>A simple DC motor was created with a ceramic magnet, paperclip, screws, 9v battery, copper wire and electrical wire.</li><li>The 9v battery generates the current that runs through the rotor.</li><li>Electrical wires were used to connect the battery to the paperclips, which held the rotor.</li><li>When the rotor sits in the paperclip supports, only the top and bottom sections experience force because they are oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field. The rotor was created by wrapping copper wire into a several coils.</li><li>A ceramic magnet was placed directly under the rotor and that is what provides the magnetic field that develops force in the wire.</li><li>The force developed in the wire depends on the amount of current in the wire, the length of the wire, and the strength of the magnetic field.</li><li>The direction of the force is based on the direction of current in the wire and the magnetic field. Depending on which side of the magnet is exposed, the direction of the resulting magnetic field changes. If the rotor contains 20 loops of wire, it experiences 20 times the force of one loop. Using right-hand rule it is clear the top and bottom sections experience a forces in a opposite directions, which tends to make the rotor rotate.</li></ul><h2 id=youtubedemonstration>Youtube Demonstration</h2><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWQ8JH-RxlY"><img src=http://img.youtube.com/vi/bWQ8JH-RxlY/0.jpg alt=Demonstration></a></p><blockquote><p><em>Click to Proceed to the Video</em></p></blockquote><h2 id=materials>Materials</h2><ol><li>9 V Battery</li><li>20 AWG Copper Wire</li><li>Paper Clips</li><li>Wood Base</li><li>Ceramic Magnet</li><li>Battery Snap</li></ol><h2 id=instructions>Instructions</h2><ol><li>Wind 20 <strong>AWG magnet wire</strong> around a small cylindrical object</li><li>Using a razor blade, strip ONLY the <strong>TOP</strong> surface of the wire.
