## What is it?

This project is a collabarative effort between the developer of `textbase,js` and I. Created with **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **TailwindCSS**, this site facilitates crypto discussion around the `Fantom Blockchain`. This site accepts **cryptocurrency** through **web3-smartcontract** interaction, the transfer of money is executed by **smart contracts** which are audited for security purposes. A **smart contract** is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between **buyer** and **seller** being directly written into lines of code. This site is a **community forum first** and currently is going through a closed-launch to a small group of users.

# Future plans?

Currently the vision is to develop this forum much further beyond what it is today: integrated payment systems, powerful marketplace features, reputation systems, developed user-groups and roles are a few things on the internal list. For now it is a unique space to share your thoughts, meet people, and make money!
